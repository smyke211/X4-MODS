# X4 MD Event Dispatch System (Binary Analysis)

Reverse engineering of X4's internal event dispatch system, focusing on how MD event cues
(like `event_object_destroyed`, `event_faction_relation_changed`) are generated and delivered.

**Game Version**: 9.0
**Image Base**: `0x140000000`
**Source**: binary analysis (RTTI tracing, vtable mapping, decompilation)

---

## Architecture Overview

X4 has **three separate event systems** that do not cross-talk:

1. **MD Event System** (documented here) — Internal typed events dispatched to Mission Director
   cue listeners. Uses integer type IDs (0-555) and polymorphic C++ event objects.
   Hooked by X4Native via `EventQueue_InsertOrDispatch` for `on_md_before/after`.

2. **Lua UI Event System** — String-named events dispatched via `genericEvent` contract to
   `RegisterEvent()` subscribers. Used for UI lifecycle events only. See GAME_LOOP.md.

3. **C++ Typed Events** — RTTI-based subsystem callbacks (e.g., `U::MoneyUpdatedEvent`).
   Internal to specific engine subsystems.

The only bridge between MD and Lua is the MD action `<raise_lua_event>`, which is a one-way
MD-to-Lua push. X4Native's `bridge_lua_event()` provides the reverse (Lua-to-C++).

## Key Functions

### EventQueue_InsertOrDispatch

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| VA | `0x140958390` |
| RVA | `0x00958390` |
| Signature | `void __fastcall(event_source* rcx, event_object* rdx, double xmm2_timestamp, char r9_immediate)` |
| Thread | Game main thread only |

Central event queue entry point. All MD events pass through here. Behavior:
- If `immediate=true` AND `timestamp <= current_game_time + 0.0001`, dispatches immediately
  via `EventQueue_ImmediateDispatch`.
- Otherwise inserts into a timestamp-sorted priority queue for deferred dispatch.
- Increments reference count on event_object when queuing.

### EventQueue_ImmediateDispatch

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| VA | `0x14095A410` |
| RVA | `0x0095A410` |
| Signature | `void __fastcall(event_source* rcx, event_object* rdx)` |

Iterates MD cue listeners stored in `qword_143886AF0` (up to 2048 entries).
Gets event type ID via `event_object->vtable[1]()`.
Calls each matching listener via `listener->vtable[4](listener, source, ctx, typeID, event)`.

### PropertyChangeDispatcher (Jump Table)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| VA | `0x14095AA50` |
| RVA | `0x0095AA50` |
| Size | ~15,056 bytes |

Massive switch/jump table with 557 cases indexed by type_id (0-555). Each case calls a
type-specific builder function to construct the corresponding event object. The type_id
is resolved from short property names (e.g., `"killed"` -> type_id 233) via binary search
in the PropertyChange Type Table at `0x142540C20`.

Note: MD descriptor IDs (e.g., 1191 for `event_object_destroyed`) are a separate namespace
used by the MD scripting layer. The dispatcher uses type_ids directly, not descriptor IDs.

## Event Object Layout

### Common Base (All Events)

```
+0x00: vtable pointer (8 bytes)        -- polymorphic dispatch
+0x08: reference count (int32)          -- starts at 0, incremented on queue insertion
+0x0C: state (int32)                    -- 1=pending, 2=dispatched, 3=consumed
+0x10: reserved (8 bytes)
+0x18: [event-specific payload begins]
```

### Virtual Function Table (All Events)

```
vtable[-1]: RTTI Complete Object Locator pointer
vtable[0]:  destructor
vtable[1]:  GetEventTypeId() -> uint32_t  (always trivial: mov eax, IMM32; ret)
vtable[2]:  (varies)
vtable[3]:  (varies)
```

## Property Descriptor ID Mapping

Maps MD cue string names to integer IDs used by the PropertyChangeDispatcher:

| MD Event Name | Prop ID |
|---|---|
| event_object_attacked | 1170 |
| event_object_hull_damaged | 1177 |
| event_object_changed_owner | 1184 |
| event_object_changed_true_owner | 1187 |
| event_object_destroyed | 1191 |
| event_object_killed_object | 1192 |
| event_contained_sector_changed_owner | 1203 |
| event_contained_sector_changed_true_owner | 1204 |
| event_player_killed_object | 1205 |
| event_player_owned_destroyed | 1209 |
| event_object_attacked_object | 1215 |
| event_build_started | 1355 |
| event_build_finished | 1356 |
| event_player_relation_changed | 1388 |
| event_faction_relation_changed | 1389 |
| event_unit_destroyed | 1394 |
| event_object_signalled | 1401 |

Property descriptor table located at `0x142262000` range, entries are 16-byte pairs:
`[string_ptr (u64)] [property_id (u64)]`.

---

## Hooking Considerations

### Single Central Hook

Hook `EventQueue_InsertOrDispatch` to intercept all events. Safe to call `vtable[1]()` in
a before-hook to get type ID. Performance impact is minimal (type ID check + switch is ~10
cycles for non-matching events). All callers are on the game main thread.

### Per-Builder Hooks

Hook individual builder functions for specific events. More surgical but requires one hook
per event type and multiple construction sites exist for some events (KilledEvent has 6+
sites, AttackedEvent has 3).

### Version Sensitivity

All addresses (functions, vtables) are version-specific and shift with game patches.
Event type ID values are historically stable across minor versions but should be verified.
Struct layouts (field offsets) are stable within a major version but could change if fields
are added. MD bridge via `<raise_lua_event>` avoids all version sensitivity.

## X4Native Implementation

This reverse engineering analysis directly enables X4Native's typed MD event subscription API.

### Hook

X4Native hooks `EventQueue_InsertOrDispatch` (single central hook approach). The detour extracts
`type_id` from each event object's vtable, constructs an `X4MdEvent` payload, and fires
before/after subscriber chains via `EventSystem::md_fire_before/after()`. See `src/core/core.cpp`.

### Auto-Generated API

The struct layouts documented above are encoded in `reference/event_layouts.csv` (discovered at
runtime by the `event_probe` example extension). The code generator (`scripts/generate_event_type_ids.ps1`)
combines this with `event_type_ids.csv` and `common.xsd` field names to produce `sdk/x4_md_events.h`:

- **261 typed data structs** (e.g., `KilledData`, `SectorChangedOwnerData`)
- **522 subscription functions** (`on_{event}_before/after`)
- Zero-copy trampoline extraction from raw event objects

### Public API

```cpp
#include <x4_md_events.h>

x4n::md::on_killed_after([](const x4n::md::KilledData& e) {
    // e.source_id, e.killer, e.kill_method, e.was_parent_killed
});
```
